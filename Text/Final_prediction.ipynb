I cant believe it is finally happening. Wait! Calm down. We arent officially a couple yet. What if I end up not liking him?  That would be horrible. Oh great, I wonder how long itll take me to finish those Calculus problems?  Ill get it done. Dont you always, Amy?  I cant believe Bob did it!  He really did it!  He is THE miracle worker. If things turn out all right I will owe him more than I can ever repay. I wonder what Steve is doing in Malaysia right now?  An entire month!  Ill likely clean out his refrigerator by then. Omigosh!  Food, lunch tomorrow, what will I ever say to him?  He is perfect in every way imaginable. It is so important for him to think of me the same way. well, maybe not Perfect, but certainly dynamic. Who would have ever thought!  Good things do indeed come to those who wait!  Oh, Ill have to remember to sign the poster he made tomorrow morning. I hope Steves alarm clock is reliable and I dont oversleep. That would be tragic if I slept til noon and missed the lunch. Thank goodness Portia is coming along. I will definitely need her support as well as Bobs. just having her there will take away some of the tension and put me more at ease. Ill have to rehearse what I say beforehand. things can only get better from here, right? hopefully. oh, Im so nervous!  He will be too. maybe even more so. it will be ok. Why in the world do humans put themselves through such torture. maybe love is really worth it?'"

I cant believe it is finally happening. Wait! Calm down. We arent officially a couple yet. What if I end up not liking him?  That would be horrible. Oh great, I wonder how long itll take me to finish those Calculus problems?  Ill get it done. Dont you always, Amy?  I cant believe Bob did it!  He really did it!  He is THE miracle worker. If things turn out all right I will owe him more than I can ever repay. I wonder what Steve is doing in Malaysia right now?  An entire month!  Ill likely clean out his refrigerator by then. Omigosh!  Food, lunch tomorrow, what will I ever say to him?  He is perfect in every way imaginable. It is so important for him to think of me the same way. well, maybe not Perfect, but certainly dynamic. Who would have ever thought!  Good things do indeed come to those who wait!  Oh, Ill have to remember to sign the poster he made tomorrow morning. I hope Steves alarm clock is reliable and I dont oversleep. That would be tragic if I slept til noon and missed the lunch. Thank goodness Portia is coming along. I will definitely need her support as well as Bobs. just having her there will take away some of the tension and put me more at ease. Ill have to rehearse what I say beforehand. things can only get better from here, right? hopefully. oh, Im so nervous!  He will be too. maybe even more so. it will be ok. Why in the world do humans put themselves through such torture. maybe love is really worth it?\n",
